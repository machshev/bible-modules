The .ZIP file contains two files:
   BFBSREC.TXT  - The text of the Syriac New Testament according to the
                  British and Foreign Bible Society's Edition
   FEATURRE.TXT - A list of all the words in BFBSREC.TXT with morphological
                  information.

BFBSREC.TXT
============
Each line represents a word in the New Testament and contains the following
fields:
   1. Database address of the entry, e.g. 0:1, 0:2, 0:3.
      Database address are always represented by 2 numbers in the form:
         FILE_NUMBER:LINE_NUMBER
      Here FILE_NUMBER is always 0.
   2. Word reference, e.g. 520100101
      - The left 2 digits represent the book (52=Matt, 53=Mark, 54=Luke, etc.)
      - Next 2 digits = chapter
      - Next 3 digits = verse
      - Next 2 digits = word
      E.g. 520100101 = Matt, Chapter 1, Verse 1, Word 1
   3. Word address in FEATURRE.TXT, e.g. 33565194d
      First convert the number into hex, e.g. 33565194d=02002A0Ah.
      The two most singnificant bytes are always 02 which represent the
      FILE_NUMBER. The remaining bytes (i.e. 002A0Ah) give LINE_NUMBER
      in FEATURRE.TXT of the word in question. You have to convert this
      number back into decimal (e.g. 002A0Ah=10762d).
      Now the first word in Matt 1.1 is the one whose address in
      in FEATURRE.TXT is 02:10762. If you look at line 02:10762 in
      FEATURERE>TXT, you will find the word "CTBA" which is the first word in
      the Gospel of Matthew!
   4. Attributes. You can ignore this field (or see Kiraz 1994).

      Database address are always represented by 2 numbers in the form:
         File_Number:Line_Number
      Here FILE_NUMBER is always 2.
   2. Consonantal Word. The word in question (only consonants).
   3. The same word with vowels and diacritic marks.
   4. Morphological Features: A long integer (32 bits). The bits are
