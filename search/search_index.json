It will allow me to study the NT in Aramaic in the same way I can the OT Hebrew and NT Greek texts.</p> <p>It's clear that Jesus spoke Aramaic, and that the whole eastern region at the time used one form of Aramaic or another. Josephus describes Greek and a foreign and an unknown tongue, showing that Greek was not widely known or understood by the Jews in the land of Israel at the time of Jesus. Hellenistic forces were actively and passionately fought against.</p> <p>Examples of Aramaic used at the time are Talmudic Aramaic, and Galilean Aramaic. There are verses in the NT Greek texts that preserve Aramaic speech, for example \"Talitha cum\" (Mark 5:41) and \"Eli Eli Lema Sabachthani\" (Matt 27:46) amongst others. Suggesting that Jesus taught using Aramaic.</p> <p>We also know that while Jesus' disciples were centred in the Galilee throughout his ministry, and then in Jerusalem immediately after his death and resurrection. The Syrian capital Antioch was the first place the disciples were called Christians.</p> <p>Acts 11:26 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</p> <p>Antioch was a Greek city founded by Seleucus one of the four generals of Alexander the Great. It contained a large Jewish population and one of the centres of Hellenistic Judaism in the region. As such it was the perfect location for both the Greek and Aramaic texts of the NT to originate... Greek for the West and Aramaic for the East.</p> <p>This is not the place to try and persuade people that Aramaic or Greek texts are the \"original\". I suspect the truth is a little more complicated, and both were divinely arranged to come about (inspired). Both to make the gospel available in the main language of the East and the West.</p> <p>From my experience so far, when it comes to English translations of both texts there is little difference and certainly no major doctrinal differences. However translation is never perfect, it's simply not possible to translate the richness of some languages into others... capturing all the cultural subtleties and plays on words. For those who can, I'd recommend learning to read the original languages.</p> <p>So what's the value of the Peshitta? It may not be the same dialect as the original Aramaic spoken by Jesus and his disciples, however it's still Aramaic and more capable of capturing the subtleties of the Hebrew/Aramaic thought we know Jesus taught in. There are several examples of two variant readings in the Greek texts being perfectly valid translations of the one Aramaic word found in the Peshitta.</p> <p>There are also a number of occasions where I've found allusions back to Hebrew OT passages via Aramaic words which share the same root as Hebrew words. Too many to be coincidence in my opinion. This is one of the unique features of the bible, especially the Hebrew; the sheer number of internal references and word link allusions is in my opinion beyond Human capability. The Peshitta seems to follow that pattern within itself and also beyond itself into the Hebrew as one united whole. The Greek NT reflects this within itself, as it would be expected to do being either directly inspired or divinely arranged translation of an inspired Aramaic text (I'm not absolutely certain which one). However it doesn't have the same capacity for the same kind of links between OT and NT, as Greek and Hebrew are very different languages and very different ways of thinking.</p> <p>Individuals will ultimately have to make their own mind up. The aim of this project is to make these texts more available than they currently are.</p>"},{"location":"#source-documents","title":"Source documents","text":""},{"location":"#peshitta-and-sedra","title":"Peshitta and SEDRA","text":"<p>The Peshitta NT text provided is the BFBS version that comes with the SEDRA 3 project distribution, a crowd sourced Syriac Lexicon project.
