"""Module to import SEDRA source files.

After generating modules from the BFBS.TXT file, it turns out there are a few
verses that are out of order in the file. So it's not possible to just assume
each line is part of a series of contiguous lines that make up verses. The whole
file needs to be parsed to ensure all the words in each verse are accounted for.

Given that, we will create an in memory structure containing all of the words in
the peshitta. Making no assumptions on the number of words or the relative
positions. Then post process that data structure to export an intemediate file
that does conform to these basic assumptions. This should speed up multiple
module generation but slow down individual module generation the first time.

Given the source files are not changing, the intemediate format will also be
checked in. Although it should be possible to regenerate it from the original
files.
